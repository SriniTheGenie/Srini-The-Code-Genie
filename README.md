Two quotes that always keeps me going are these !!

“I am not a visionary. I'm an engineer. I'm happy with the people who are wandering around looking at the stars but I am looking at the ground and I want to fix the pothole before I fall in.”
― Linus Torvalds


“The real student is studying, learning, inquiring, exploring, not just until he is twenty or twenty-five, but throughout life.”
— JK
